## Description
**TaskMatrix.AI** is an AI ecosystem that can connect foundation models with millions of APIs for task completion. Unlike most previous work that aimed to improve a single AI model, TaskMatrix.AI focuses more on using existing foundation models (as a brain-like central system) and APIs of other AI models and systems (as sub-task solvers) to achieve diversified tasks in both digital and physical domains. Visual ChatGPT is just an example of applying TaskMatrix.AI to the visual domain.
