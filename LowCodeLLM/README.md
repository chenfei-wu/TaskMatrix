# Low-code LLM

**Low-code LLM** is a novel human-LLM interaction pattern, involving human in the loop to achieve more controllable and stable responses.

As shown in the following figure: 
- A Planning LLM generates a workflow for the complex tasks. The workflow is highly structured and support users to easily edit it with dragging and dropping.
- Users can edit the workflow in six pre-defined low-code operations, which are all supported by clicking, dragging or text editing. 
- The reviewed workflow will guide the Implement LLM to generate responses. 
- Users can continue refining the workflow  until getting a satisfactory results.
